== summary ==
add sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar and test.db into the same directoy 

== Description ==
I used sqlite database instead of a regular txt file to read and write the data.
In the Init command a table is created and in subsequent commands 
database does all the necessary CRUD operations while checking for possible corner cases.
To execute this program class path need to be set and it is done in the assn4 bash script.
However the program to work the sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar file should be in the same folder (.jar file is included in the submission).
And also please add the test.db into the directory as well 
Please make sure to have the sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar file in the same directory.
